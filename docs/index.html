  <h1>Plugging the gap</h1>
   <h1>NHS “brain-drains” other countries for a quick fix to workforce shortages.</h1>

<p>
 The NHS staffing crisis means that A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade, and the axing of NHS bursaries has seen a reduction in UK trainees replenishing the workforce.
 </p>
<p>
Nursing makes up one of the largest proportions of the NHS. There are 50,000 nursing vacancies at present, and it is on the UK’s shortage occupation list. Instead of investing in educating, training and retention of the UK workforce, the NHS looks overseas for a “quick fix” to plug the gap.
  </p>
<h3>
  There are two ways in which this is done: </h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Active recruitment</b> – where the NHS will go to a country such as India and actively recruit a number of health workers.
  <li><b>Passive recruitment</b> – an individual health worker seeks out overseas work due to dissatisfaction with their job.
 </ul>
<p>
Overseas health workers are vital to the service, they make up almost half of the NHS workforce. Fiona Johnson from the Nuffield Trust says that “even in the best-case scenarios, we will need to try to attract recruits from outside the UK”.
 </p>
<p>
The UK government proposes to inject £20.5bn into the NHS by 2023/4 under the Long-Term Plan. Experts agree that a significant amount of this should be allocated to developing the workforce. 
 </p>
<p>
  <h3>The scale of the problem</h3>
 </p>
<p>
Research by the Nuffield Trust, Kings Fund and The Health Foundation warns that:
  </p>

 <div class= "block-quote">
<p><i>“On current trends, in 10 years’ time the NHS will have a shortfall of 108,000 full-time equivalent nurses. Half this gap could be bridged by increasing the number of nurses joining the NHS from training.”</i>

   <h2>Nursing as a major export in the Philippines</h2>  
 <h3>
While recruiting from overseas may relieve the strains on the NHS in the short-term, relying heavily upon overseas nurses rather than building up the UK’s workforce is unsustainable and unethical. 
    </h3> <p>
There may be a mutual benefit for the individual who develops their skills and progresses in their career. However, as seen by the following example, this does not automatically mean a mutual benefit for the source countries.
    </p>
    <p>
According to a <a href= "https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Empire_of_Care.html?id=lKw170ErqnUC&redir_esc=y">
      private study</a>, 85 per cent of Filipino nurses are abroad.    
  </p>
    <p>
Filipino nurses made up the largest proportion of NHS overseas nurses last year, with over ten thousand of them working here in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
Whilst the Filipino government benefits from the trade, the funding does not necessarily go back into the healthcare system. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>Brain draining the Philippines</b></h2>
    <p>
According to Jocelyn Andamo, Secretary General of Filipino Nurses United, remittances from overseas workers amount to more than 17 per cent of the GDP. 
    </p>
    <p>
Yet, the Filipino government only invests 2 per cent of its GDP in the health system, which is below the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendation of 5 per cent. 
    </p>
   <h2><b>A vicious cycle</b></h2>
<p>
Jocelyn says, “the supply of nurses [in the Philippines] is not a problem”, rather, it’s the retention of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
Listen: From an internet café in Manila, Jocelyn describes what it’s like to be a nurse in the Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
Out… more nurses to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
Jocelyn says that a horrifying 3 in 5 patients in the Philippines will die without seeing any medical personnel.
