<p>
 The NHS staffing crisis means that A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade, and the axing of NHS bursaries has seen a reduction in UK trainees replenishing the workforce.
 </p>
<p>
Nursing makes up one of the largest proportions of the NHS. There are 50,000 nursing vacancies at present, and it is on the UK’s shortage occupation list. Instead of investing in educating, training and retention of the UK workforce, the NHS looks overseas for a “quick fix” to plug the gap.
  </p>
<h3>
  There are two ways in which this is done: </h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Active recruitment</b> – where the NHS will go to a country such as India and actively recruit a number of health workers.
  <li><b>Passive recruitment</b> – an individual health worker seeks out overseas work due to dissatisfaction with their job.
 </ul>
<p>
Overseas health workers are vital to the service, they make up almost half of the NHS workforce. Fiona Johnson from the Nuffield Trust says that “even in the best-case scenarios, we will need to try to attract recruits from outside the UK”.
 </p>
<p>
The UK government proposes to inject £20.5bn into the NHS by 2023/4 under the Long-Term Plan. Experts agree that a significant amount of this should be allocated to developing the workforce. 
 </p>
<p>
  <h3>The scale of the problem</h3>
 </p>
<p>
Research by the Nuffield Trust, Kings Fund and The Health Foundation warns that:
  </p>
  </div>
<p><i>“On current trends, in 10 years’ time the NHS will have a shortfall of 108,000 full-time equivalent nurses. Half this gap could be bridged by increasing the number of nurses joining the NHS from training.”</i>
   </p>

   <h2>Nursing as a major export in the Philippines</h2>  
 <h3>
While recruiting from overseas may relieve the strains on the NHS in the short-term, relying heavily upon overseas nurses rather than building up the UK’s workforce is unsustainable and unethical. 
    </h3> <p>
There may be a mutual benefit for the individual who develops their skills and progresses in their career. However, as seen by the following example, this does not automatically mean a mutual benefit for the source countries.
    </p>
    <p>
According to a <a href= "https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Empire_of_Care.html?id=lKw170ErqnUC&redir_esc=y">
      private study</a>, 85 per cent of Filipino nurses are abroad.    
  </p>
    <p>
Filipino nurses made up the largest proportion of NHS overseas nurses last year, with over ten thousand of them working here in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
Whilst the Filipino government benefits from the trade, the funding does not necessarily go back into the healthcare system. 
    </p>
    <h2>Brain draining the Philippines</h2>
    <p>
According to Jocelyn Andamo, Secretary General of Filipino Nurses United, remittances from overseas workers amount to more than 17 per cent of the GDP. 
    </p>
    <p>
Yet, the Filipino government only invests 2 per cent of its GDP in the health system, which is below the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendation of 5 per cent. 
    </p>
   <h2A vicious cycle</h2>
<p>
Jocelyn says, “the supply of nurses [in the Philippines] is not a problem”, rather, it’s the retention of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Listen:</b> From an internet café in Manila, Jocelyn describes what it’s like to be a nurse in the Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>
Jocelyn says that a horrifying 3 in 5 patients in the Philippines will die without seeing any medical personnel.
    </p>
<h2>WHO’s to blame?</h2>

<p>
	An analysis of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (2010), in which the Philippines was one of the source countries studied, has found that:
</p>
<p>
“The Code does not have prominence in those countries that need it most, namely those still lacking sufficient health workers and experiencing ongoing out-migration of those they train.”
</p>
<p>
The code of practice provides guidance to member states for the ethical recruitment and mobility of health workers between source and destination country. 
</p>
<p>
The same study also found that there was little to no awareness of this code of practice amongst destination countries, and it was “all but absent in policy documents.”
</p>


<h2>Paying to save lives</h2>

<p>
	Attracted to the UK by the prospects of better pay and career development, migrant health workers take the leap of faith, leaving behind their homes, families and culture. 
</p>
<p>
In December 2018, the UK government made this transition even harder when MPs voted in favour of doubling the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS). 
</p>
<p>
The IHS is required of every worker from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for them to have use of the NHS during their time in the UK. If the worker brings family, this charge is also applied to each family member for each year of the working visa. 
</p>

<h2>“spiralling extra charges”</h2>

The now £400 fee (January 2019), which could be equivalent to four months’ wage for a nurse in the Philippines, has to be paid up-front and in addition to National Insurance and tax.
</p>
<p>
The government’s decision to double this charge has not been well received by OSNs who feel unappreciated by the government.
</p>
<p>
“It’s too much”, says Kemi, a Nigerian nurse working in London. She migrated to the UK fifteen years ago, before the IHS was implemented. 
</p>
<p>
She feels that this charge could even put other Nigerian nurses off coming. Luckily for Kemi, her daughter was born in the UK, and so she only needs to find £400 a year to pay her own surcharge. 
</p>
<p>
Supporting the NHS in more ways than one
</p>
<p>
The Home Office estimates this higher fee could “raise” an extra £220m a year for the NHS. 
</p>
<p>
But the Nursing and Midwifery Council are campaigning against the government’s decision, stating that:
</p>
<p>
“The very people who deliver healthcare should be the last people to have to pay spiralling extra charges for it.” - Professor Dame Donna Kinnair, RCN General Secretary.
</p>
<p>
A spokesperson from the Home Office says:
</p>
<p>
“Although some temporary migrants will be paying tax and National Insurance contributions, they will not have made the same financial contribution to the NHS which most UK nationals and permanent residents have made... It is therefore fair to require them to make an up-front and proportionate contribution to the NHS.
</p>
<p>
We value the contribution overseas nurses make to the health system; and nurses will benefit from a pay increase as set out in the Agenda for Change framework.”
</p>
<h2>
Could Brexit force the NHS to invest internally in the workforce?
</h2>
<p>
Since the EU referendum in 2017, there have been reports about a reduction in EU health workers staying in the UK due to the uncertainty of Brexit. 
</p>
<p>
If this happens extensively, the NHS could see the influx of more non-EEA migrants or invest in the training and replenishing of the UK workforce under the Long-Term Plan.
</p>
<p>
However, Lucia Leite, president of the Portuguese nursing union, Associação Sindical Portuguesa dos Enfermeiros, thinks Brexit will not be an obstacle. She says:
</p>
<p>
“We know that the UK has reduced the number of [nursing] schools and nurses, so they will easily come and pick nurses [who are] already trained from Portugal… Brexit is happening because the UK wants to stop the levels of immigration which have been high for a long time, but the immigration they want to avoid is not from nurses, so I’m sure they will find a way to salvage the qualified professionals who are needed by the country.”

</p>
<p>
Whilst the NHS is a more attractive employer to many international health workers, improvement to the source country’s health system appears to be the key to retaining staff and reducing the brain-draining effects of outward-migration.
</p>
<p>
Lucia comments on the state of the healthcare system in Portugal, where nurses who have practised for up to 25 years could be getting paid the same as a newly qualified nurse. 
</p>
<h2>
The case of South Africa
</h2>
<p>
Outward-migration of health workers from South Africa has been on the decrease since the early 2000’s according to this 2015 study, which cites the internal reforms being a contributing factor to retaining its workforce. 
</p>
<h2>
Creating a sustainable health system
</h2>
<p>
It appears that whilst the push factors outweigh the pull factors, nurses and other skilled health workers will continue to migrate in search of a better standard of living.
</p>
<p>
The analysis of the WHO code of practice concludes by suggesting the code be made more mandatory to member states. An interviewee from the study in India says that the code “has no teeth” with it’s voluntary status.
</p>
<p>
In addition, increasing awareness of the code and encouraging source and destination countries to work together and create a more sustainable, ethical exchange of health workers will help to significantly reduce the brain drain of source countries.
