-	The NHS is not investing in training new nurses but rather, recruiting overseas and saving money
-	It is contributing towards a brain drain of countries, particularly in Asia, where health workers are desperately needed in their own countries
-	The doubling of the immigration health surcharge to “fund” the NHS is seen as hypocritical by OSNs.

The NHS is struggling to meet the demands of Britain’s growing and ageing population. A huge shortage of staff means that A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade, and axing of the NHS bursaries has seen a reduction in new recruits replenishing the workforce. 

Nursing makes up one of the largest proportions of the NHS. There are currently 50,000 nursing vacancies. Instead of investing in educating, training and retention of the workforce, the NHS looks overseas for a quick fix to plugging the gap. 

Overseas health workers (OHWs) make up almost half of the NHS workforce. They are vital to the service. Fiona Johnson from the Nuffield Trust has said “even in the best-case scenarios, we will need to try to attract recruits from outside the UK”.

As the Long-Term plan is set to be implemented over the next few years, I look into the current patterns of recruitment in the NHS and how the government goes about plugging the gap in the workforce. 

Below are a series of case studies which paints a picture of the UK’s relationship with source countries.
